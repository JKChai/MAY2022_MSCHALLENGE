# Introduction

Azure Cognitive Search is a cloud-native search service that provides an expanded set of query functionality over a large variety and volume of data. A search service is ideal for scenarios where your developer team would like to implement search-specific features such as filters, faceting, autocomplete, and synonym matching without the complexity of trying to implement these features directly in the database source. In this module, you will explore how Azure Cognitive Search can crawl data from the Azure Cosmos DB SQL API.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

* Create an indexer to migrate data from Azure Cosmos DB SQL API to an Azure Cognitive Search index

# Create an indexer for data in Azure Cosmos DB SQL API

An **Azure Cognitive Search** instance is comprised of a few core components:

* **Indexes** that contain JSON documents that are searchable
* **Indexers** to crawl data from various data sources and insert them into indexes
* **Data Sources** that connect Azure Cognitive Search to various data platforms

In the case of Azure Cosmos DB SQL API, you can configure a container as a **data source**, create a query and a frequency that the **indexer** will use to crawl data, and create a target **index** where the resulting searchable JSON documents are stored.

## Connecting a data source

The first step is to create a data source. The data source points to somewhere where data is stored. With Azure Cosmos DB SQL API, the data source is a reference to an existing account with the following parameters configured:

| Parameter | Value |
|-----|-----|
| Connection string | Connection string for Azure Cosmos DB account |
| Database | Name of target database |
| Collection | Name of target container |
| Query | A SQL query to select items to be indexed |

## Customizing the index

Once the data source is configured, an index should be created that would be the target of the indexing operation. The index contains, at a minimum, a **name** and a **key**. The key refers to a unique identifier field for each JSON document in the index.

Each field in the index should be configured to enable or disable features when searching. These optional features allow extra search functionality on specific fields when it makes sense. For each field, you must configure whether the field is:

| Feature | Description |
|-----|-----|
| Retrievable | Configures the field to be projected in search result sets |
| Filterable | Accepts OData-style filtering on the field |
| Sortable | Enables sorting using the field |
| Facetable | Allows field to be dynamically aggregated and grouped |
| Searchable | Allows search queries to match terms in the field |

## Configuring the indexer

The final step is to configure the indexerâ€™s **name** and **schedule**. The schedule determines how often the indexer will run to pull data from the data source and populate the index with JSON documents.

# Implement a change detection policy

The default query for the Azure Cosmos DB SQL API data source is the following SQL query.

```sql
SELECT
    *
FROM
    c
WHERE
    c._ts >= @HighWaterMark
ORDER BY
    c._ts
```

This query only finds items whose **timestamp** (`_ts` property) is greater than or equal to a built-in high watermark field. The high watermark field comes from a built-in change detection policy that attempts to identify whether an item has been changed or not.

To accomplish change detection, the indexer will index all items returned by the query. It will then store a timestamp as the high watermark. The next indexer run will then index items with a timestamp greater than or equal to the stored high watermark. This strategy effectively indexes all items that have been created or changed since the last run.

If your SQL query sorts the items to index using the timestamp, then Azure Cognitive Search can implement incremental progress during indexing. If the indexer fails for a transient reason, sorting the timestamps will allow the indexer to resume indexing from the failure point instead of reindexing the entire container again. This setting must be enabled when configuring the data source.

In the default query example, the result set is sorted using the `_ts` field. If you write a custom query, you must sort using the same field to enable incremental progress when indexing.

# Manage a data deletion detection policy

If an item is deleted from a container in Azure Cosmos DB SQL API, that item may not be deleted from the index in Azure Cognitive Search. To enable tracking of deleted items, you must configure a policy to track when an item is deleted.

Azure Cognitive Search supports, exclusively, the ability to track if an item is deleted using a combination of a field and value in a soft-delete scenario. For example, consider this JSON document that has a property named `_isDeleted` with a value of `true`.

```json
{
  "id": "E08E4507-9666-411B-AAC4-519C00596B0A",
  "categoryId": "86F3CBAB-97A7-4D01-BABB-ADEFFFAED6B4",
  "sku": "TI-R092",
  "name": "LL Road Tire",
  "_isDeleted": true
}
```

Using the soft-delete policy, the `softDeleteColumnName` for the data source (Azure Cosmos DB SQL API) would be configured as `_isDeleted`. The `softDeleteMarkerValue` would then be set to `true`. Using this strategy, Azure Cognitive Search will remove items that have been `soft-deleted` from the container.

# Knowledge Check

1. To enable the ability to index changes in Azure Cosmos DB SQL API items, which field should you include in the data source's SQL query?

- [ ] partitionKey
- [ ] id
- [x] _ts
> Correct. The _ts field is required to enable the high watermark policy to track changes to existing items.

2. Your Azure Cosmos DB SQL API solution regularly uses a time-to-live value to automatically delete items after a set amount of time. Which strategy should you use to ensure that the deleted items are also deleted in the search index?

- [x] Configure a soft-delete policy with a tracked column and value
> Correct. A soft-delete column and value is required to enable the soft-delete column deletion detection policy.
- [ ] No configuration is required, Azure Cognitive Search will automatically remove data from the index
- [ ] Configure a high watermark policy that is mapped to the timestamp (_ts) field
